# Restaurant Application Improvement Tasks

This document contains a detailed checklist of actionable improvement tasks for the Restaurant application. Tasks are organized into architectural improvements and code-level improvements.

## Architectural Improvements

1. [ ] Implement proper configuration management
   - [ ] Extract MongoDB connection string to a configuration file
   - [ ] Add support for different environments (dev, test, prod)

2. [ ] Improve project structure
   - [ ] Create a proper layered architecture (controller, service, repository)
   - [ ] Separate UI logic from business logic

3. [ ] Implement proper error handling strategy
   - [ ] Create custom exceptions for different error scenarios
   - [ ] Implement a centralized error handling mechanism

4. [ ] Add logging framework
   - [ ] Integrate a proper logging framework (e.g., Log4j, SLF4J)
   - [ ] Configure appropriate log levels for different environments
   - [ ] Add meaningful log messages throughout the application

5. [ ] Implement data validation
   - [ ] Add input validation for all user inputs
   - [ ] Implement bean validation for model classes

6. [ ] Add unit and integration tests
   - [ ] Set up a testing framework (JUnit, Mockito)
   - [ ] Write unit tests for service classes
   - [ ] Write integration tests for database operations

7. [ ] Implement dependency injection
   - [ ] Consider using a DI framework (Spring, Guice)
   - [ ] Remove manual dependency management

8. [ ] Add database migration support
   - [ ] Implement a database migration tool (Flyway, Liquibase)
   - [ ] Create initial schema migration scripts

## Code-Level Improvements

1. [ ] Fix bugs in RestaurantService
   - [ ] Fix getRestaurantById method (using "id" instead of "_id")
   - [ ] Fix error handling in restaurant operations

2. [ ] Remove code duplication
   - [ ] Eliminate duplicate getRestaurantById method in OrderService
   - [ ] Create reusable utility methods for common operations

3. [ ] Improve error handling
   - [ ] Add consistent try-catch blocks in all service methods
   - [ ] Provide meaningful error messages to users

4. [ ] Enhance input validation
   - [ ] Add validation for all user inputs
   - [ ] Implement proper error messages for invalid inputs

5. [ ] Standardize code style
   - [ ] Translate non-English comments and strings to English
   - [ ] Apply consistent formatting across all files
   - [ ] Add proper JavaDoc comments to all classes and methods

6. [ ] Refactor complex methods
   - [ ] Break down long methods into smaller, focused methods
   - [ ] Reduce nesting levels in control structures

7. [ ] Improve MongoDB operations
   - [ ] Use proper MongoDB query operators
   - [ ] Optimize database queries for better performance

8. [ ] Enhance model classes
   - [ ] Add proper validation in model classes
   - [ ] Implement equals and hashCode methods
   - [ ] Add toString method for better debugging

9. [ ] Implement proper resource management
   - [ ] Ensure all resources are properly closed (Scanner, MongoClient)
   - [ ] Use try-with-resources where appropriate

10. [ ] Add documentation
    - [ ] Add README.md with project description and setup instructions
    - [ ] Document API endpoints and data models
    - [ ] Add comments explaining complex business logic

11. [ ] Improve user interface
    - [ ] Add better formatting for console output
    - [ ] Implement a more intuitive menu system
    - [ ] Add confirmation prompts for destructive operations

12. [ ] Enhance security
    - [ ] Implement proper authentication and authorization
    - [ ] Secure database connection
    - [ ] Add input sanitization to prevent injection attacks
